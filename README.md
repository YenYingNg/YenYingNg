## Short Bio

I am a PhD student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland. I am interested in such areas as AI in education, distance learning, and linguistics.
I am currently working on a project that aims to develop a speech recognition model that provides feedback on both sound and tone correctness in Mandarin Chinese for our vocabulary dataset. If the developed model can achieve similar results to human teachers in evaluating speech performance, it can potentially be integrated into online courses to save teachers' time and provide instant feedback.
